## Intent: This is a short, automated version of the file 02_movement_modes_2018_06_d23.R
## whose purpose is to perform a 2-state Hidden Markov Chain and classify location as dis-
## persive or not. The function feeds on the exploration done by Bernardo but does not 
## contain any of it, for the purpose of generating a routine that can be fed new data
## at ease.


## Input: an Geopackage file, with locations. Each location must contain coordinates in 
## a projected coordinate system along with timestamp and individual identification.

## Output: An RData file with an object mov.track.rsp of class track.xyt and with a column 
## containing "dispersal" or "residencency" behavior categorization.

                                          thetas = c(0, pi/4, pi/2, 0) , kappas= c(0.1, 1, 5, 2) ) {

## Load location file

## Execute resampling per individual
# Since track.xyt objects cannot be used with group_by(), we used nest() and map() to repeat
# process for every jaguar

                 unnest(data.rsp) %>% 
                 mutate(hour = t_ %>% format('%H') %>% as.factor)

## Add jaguar name to burst_ variable so we can use bursts can be uniquely identified in the dataset
# (Althought this information is not used in the rest of the script)
mov.track.rsp <- mov.track.rsp %>%
  mutate(brst = paste0(Name, burst_))

## Change coordinates for numberical stability(?) in the HMM. 
mov.track.rsp <- mov.track.rsp %>%

    x = x_/1000,
    y = y_/1000,

## Convert to fitHMM format

  dplyr::select(ID,x,y) %>%
  as.data.frame %>% 
  prepData(type='UTM', coordNames = c('x', 'y'))

## Setting initial parameters for gamma and von Mises distributions,
## in a 4-state model on step length and turning angles.
# No covariates are used in this model.
# We are using state 4 as the definition of "dispersal", and considering everyone else
# to be a residence status.
# This may require input to validate that new iterations will have the same state as dispersal

stepPar1   <- c(mus, sigmas,zeromasses)
anglePar1  <- c(thetas, kappas)

m5 <- fitHMM(data = hmm.data, nbStates = 4, stepPar0 = stepPar1, 
             anglePar0 = anglePar1, formula = ~1)

## Ask user to input state to be considered dispersal
plot(m5)
dispstate <- readline("What states should we consider dispersal? (if there more than one state separate by commas) \n")
dispstate <- as.numeric( strsplit(dispstate,",")[[1]] )

## create final object with locations and dispersal data
mov.track <- mov.track.rsp %>% 
  mutate(state = as.factor(ifelse(viterbi(m5) %in% dispstate, 'dispersal', 'residency'))) %>%
  make_track(.x = x_, .y=y_, .t=t_, ID, Name, burst_, brst, state, crs = CRS(st_crs(fixes.geo)[[2]]))
